h1. tagbrowser - Technology agnostic browser component

This is a simple layer on top of apaches http components. Its interfaces resembles that of a web browser:
<pre><code>
TagBrowser browser = new TagBrowser();
browser.open("https://github.com/joergviola/play-cms");
browser.clickName("About");
TagForm form = browser.getForm(1);
form.setField("user", "test1");
form.setField("pwd", "test2");
form.submit("Register");
</code></pre>
Besides being able to write simple scripts against web sites, these scripts are technology agnostic: Under the hood, the tagbrowser handles all the subtle details of state managements introduced by different technologies. PHP, Ruby, Java frameworks - they all handle state management slightly different.

By only offering the high-level interface, tagbrowser can do all cookie and URL handling and thus provide technology agnostic scripts.
